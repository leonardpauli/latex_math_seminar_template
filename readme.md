# latex math seminar template

### Usage

Either just copy the files into overleaf, or, for instance, if using vscode with "latex workshop" plugin:

- `git clone (this repo) seminar1 && cd $_`
- `code .` (to open the editor)
- `cmd-P`, "main.tex", enter (to open the file)
- `cmd-shift-P`, "view pdf in tab", enter
- make change, `cmd-s`, and see the pdf auto-update

Create a file `.local.pnr.tex` with your student-id/personal-nr to avoid having it committed to git.
